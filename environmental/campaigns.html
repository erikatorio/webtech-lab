			<h2>ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNS</h2>

			<h3>Proper Waste Segregation</h3>
			<p>We encourage the people of our barangay to dispose of their garbage and other waste according to the city ordinance:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Discharging any bodily waste such as urinating or spitting and scattering of any personal garbage such as pieces of paper in public is discouraged. Waste and garbage must be disposed of properly in proper locations and designated garbage bins.</li>
				<li>Dumping of garbage and other refuse in drainage systems and waterways natural or artificial is not allowed. These waterways must be kept clean and maintained in order to prevent blockages and flooding issues.</li>
				<li>Picking up of litter and disposing of it properly is encouraged as it is the responsibility of every person enjoying the public space.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Clean-up Drive</h3>
			<p>We look to increase the support of the community towards improving barangay the living condition and to promote a clean and green environment.</p>

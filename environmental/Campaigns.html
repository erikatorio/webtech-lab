	<h2>ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNS</h2>
	<p>We have put up the following operations on helping solve the environmental
	issues within our barangay for the preservation of the land and
	improvement of the current state of the surroundings.</p>
	<p>We also invite the members of our community in taking part and
	making a difference in the environment of our barangay. As this is not only
	our home but also theirs.</p>
	<h3>Proper Waste Segregation</h3>
	<p>We encourage the people of our barangay to dispose of their garbage
	and other waste according to the city ordinance:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Discharging any bodily waste such as urinating or spitting
		and scattering of any personal garbage such as pieces of paper in
		public is discouraged. Waste and garbage must be disposed of properly
		in proper locations and designated garbage bins.</li>
		<li>Dumping of garbage and other refuse in drainage systems and
		waterways natural or artificial is not allowed. These waterways
		must be kept clean and maintained in order to prevent blockages
		and flooding issues.</li>
		<li>Picking up of litter and disposing of it properly is encouraged
		as it is the responsibility of every person enjoying the
		public space.</li>

	<h2>WELCOME!</h2>
	<h3>Welcome to the Bakakeng Norte Environmental Protection
	Advocacy site!</h3>
	<p>We are looking to influence the people within our community
	to bring a positive change on the environment. The barangay is important
	to us as it is important to those who reside within its boundaries because
	it is our home. We seek to improve the state of our surroundings while
	also striving to set an example for others to follow.</p>
	<p>Our goals and objectives are not only for the current inhabitants
	but also for future generations to come.</p>
	<h3>An Educated Barangay</h3>
	<p><i>"Knowledge is Power. Information is Liberating. Education is the premise of progress." - Kofi Annan</i></p>
	<p>An educated people means a powerful community. The more people know about the issues
	concerning our surroundings and how to care for the environment, the more responsible
	they will be about their actions. Awareness is essential in caring for the environment,
	the knowledge that the land, unless cared for by those who inhabit it, will wither
	and become useless.</p>
	<h3>Peace Loving and Empowered</h3>
	<p><i>"Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending." - Maria Robinson</i></p>
	<p>Environmental care encourages <i>bayanihan</i> to take place in a community. The
	people will work together during times of calamities to keep each other safe from the
	dangers of the environment. Proper care of the surroundings through tree planting
	activities and common courtesy on waste management are a big help in preserving
	and maintaining the environment.</p>
	<h3>Progressive Community</h3>
	<p><i>"The greatest good for the greatest number." - Jeremy Bentham</i></p>
	<p>The community committing to protecting the environment today will mean so much more
	to the following generations who will acquire the land in the future. The current
	inhabitants will set an example for the next ones who will claim the legacy
	which, in turn, will also continue to find ways on protecting their inheritance, which will
	also then be passed on to the next ones, and onto the next.</p>

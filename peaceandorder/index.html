	<h2>What is Peace and Order?</h2>

	<image class = "vimage" src = "./images/image2.jpg" alt="Image2">
        <p>	Peace and Order is vital thing in this world. Without it, the world would be in chaos. Peace and Order calls for a system. A structure. If you look around, the world is still not safe. Rape cases. Violence. Murders, some even done in a massive scale. Racism. Poverty. Peace and Order covers these all. It is at our hands that the world is shaped into this reality. This means we can either keep it as it is or we do something about it.</p>
        
        <h2>Peace and Order in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>Peace and Order is a central issue to most of the ordinary Filipino people/family. Without peace and order, it would be hard for them to assume that the people they care about, even themselves would have the necessities that every normal people should have a proper education, a shelter to live in, a safe community to function in, and a bright future ahead of them. With peace and order comes freedom from fear. Freedom from fear means proper security for each and every Filipino people, thus leading to progress, wherein not only our country will be the benificiary, but the people who are residing in it as well. </p>

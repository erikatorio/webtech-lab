	<p>	Peace and Order is vital thing in this world. Without it, the world would be in chaos. Peace and Order calls for a system. A structure. If you look around, the world is still not safe. Rape cases. Violence. Murders, some even done in a massive scale. Racism. Poverty. Peace and Order covers these all. It is at our hands that the world is shaped into this reality. This means we can either keep it as it is or we do something about it. </p>
